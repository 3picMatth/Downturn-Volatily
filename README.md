# Downturn-Volatily
The program takes as input an Excel file named "Assets Return," containing the daily returns of the assets in the portfolio. It then prompts the user to assign weights to each asset, ensuring they sum to 1. Finally, it calculates the relative and maximum drawdown and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the portfolio's average and maximum future drawdowns.

--> All the data given in input are randomly generated
