# Downturn-Volatily
A Python program to analyze portfolio drawdowns. It reads historical asset returns from Excel, lets users define portfolio weights, calculates weighted mean and standard deviation, and uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict future drawdowns. Results include key statistics and a visual distribution of simulated drawdowns.
